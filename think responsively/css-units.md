There are difeerent types of units that we can use. CSS units come in a few different flavors;
1- Absolute Units
2- Relative Units
3- Percentage

1- Absolute units are the easiest to understand:
- Pixels (px)
- pt, cm, mm, in, etc

2- Percetage: are mainly used for widths and pretty easy to understand. It's relative to their parent except for height.

3- Relative: There are two different types of relative units;
- Relative to font-size;
- em and rem 
- Relative to the viewport; vw, vh, vmin, vmax

Percentages: 

The REM unit is used for Root Em. That means it's always relative to the root of our document. The root of an HTML page is always the HTML element.
